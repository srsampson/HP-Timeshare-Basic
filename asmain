;The following attach was used to configure and link the IOP image.
;Note: The trap below needs to get hit twice before removal,
;      before the IO module can be loaded. This session is documented
;      at the end of the asiop script, because it has the IOP linkage maps
;      for that processor. Yes it was done here but should be kept there.
;Should anyone doubt the logic in using a paper tape punch as
;a stand-in for an interconnect kit, I would call your attention
;to the IOPs own loader. The listing can be found in the HP 2000
;Access Operator's Manual (22687-90005) Appendix D pages D-2 and D-3
;Where it would seem that, for this job, the two are interchangeable.

;Note: The following note has a better work-around. See below.
;
;Note: As of this time MCP will hang after the "2754?" question.
; this seems to be a timing bug in the tape drive simulation.
; the work-around is to set a trap at 2770(8), restart MCP at 2000(8),
; let trap get sprung, remove trap, run simulation. (Oops, you will need 
; to let the trap get sprung twice if it is the IO module you want. For
; log of that session see the end of asiop)
